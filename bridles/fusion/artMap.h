 * This is the interface of the multi-directional (un-)supervised ARTMAP
 * This is a modifdng but also
 * one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many mappings to multiple ART categories are possible.
 *
 * The ARTMAP is standard un-supervised, by using a sort of Hebbian learning the weights of all the
 * ART categories to a single map are learned. All the single ART networks are suppose to present
 * the right output wrong output categories are matched but by using a slow learning rate, noise
 * doesn't effect the system to much. When one ART network output is missing it will be predicted
 * by the system.
 *
 * When an ART network has the status supervisor, this network can initiate match-tracking, for
 * the classes that gave the wrong output by using the map vigilance.
 *
 * This version only handles WTA for the moment

/**
 * The most normal ARTMAP exists out of two ART networks that are coupled to each other by a
 * so-called "map field". To one of the ART networks, say ART_a, is an input vector fed, which needs
 * to be classified. We happen to have another ART network which we already trained before, ART_b,
 * and now we want to use that network to supervise ART_a. This means we have to synchronize the
 * long-term memory nodes (in F2) of each network. This synchronization is done via map field F_ab.
 * A first thought would synchronize in such way that in ART_a a specific node F2_a[i] synchronizes
 * with the same specific node in ART_b, F2_b[i]. However, we do not expect in all cases to have
 * something represented by just one node in F2, a prototype can be a distributed set of activations.
 * Moreover, we also do not care about having the same representation of this prototype in ART_a
 * versus ART_b. What we only care about that if these prototypes synchronize! That is why there is
 * this "complicated" map field concept. The synchronization happens when a node in the map field
 * is activated by both ART networks.
