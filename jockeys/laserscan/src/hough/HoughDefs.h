 * a.) defining a set of K radial lines
 * b.) representing the points in polar coordinates
 * c.) projecting the points on each of the lines, in other words, rotating the points and ordering them in the line
 *    reference frame
 * d.) for each two subsequent points on each line, cast a vote
 * e.) pick triplets with maximum number of votes out of the array, remove segments that contain the middle point
 * f.) iterate this until all points are gone
 *
 * Probably e and f can again be formulated as a TSP, now with the number of cities equal to K.
